    <h1>Making the Sauce</h1>
    <br>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    
    <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>1 tbsp flour</li>
    <li>200ml milk</li>
    <li>Seasonings of choice (salt/white pepper), nutmeg, mustard</li>
    <li><i>Optional: 100g cheese of your choice (grated)</i></li>
    
    <br>
    <h5>Method</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat</li>
        <li>Add the flour and whisk until incorporated</li>
        <li>Cook the flour and butter out for a minute to prevent the end product tasting of raw flour</li>
        <li>Gradually add the milk as you whisk, the milk is added slowly so we can avoid lumps in the final sauce</li>
        <li>Once smooth you can add your seasonings. Salt, white pepper and nutmeg is traditionally used in a regular white sauce</li>
        <li>If adding cheese you can now add it to the sauce whilst constantly stirring to prevent it clumping up and burning at the bottom, you want to use a low heat so as to not split the cheese</li>
        <li>Adding cheese to the sauce makes it into a mornay sauce, I also like to add whole grain mustard and swap out the white pepper for black pepper</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The sauce is now ready, it should be just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, the next recipe is for <a href="../recipes/pasta.html">fresh pasta</a> which we'll eventually turn into a lasagne.</p>
