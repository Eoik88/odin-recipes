    <h1>Making the lasagne</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Once you've made the white/cheese sauce and your pasta is rolled out you're ready to make the lasagne.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    
    <li>Ground beef/pork meat</li>
    <li>Carrot</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Celery</li>
    <li><i>Optional:</i> Red wine</li>
    <li>Fresh pasta/dried lasagne sheets</li>
    <li>White sauce/cheese sauce</li>
    <li>Grated cheese</li>
    <li>Salt/pepper</li>
    
    <br>
    <h5>Method</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the carrot, celery, onion and garlic then gently soften in a pan in that order so as to not overcook any of the vegetables</li>
        <li>Add gently brown the meat of your choice (some recipes use a mix of beef/pork/veal)</li>
        <li>Add a small amount of red wine and allow the alcohol to cook off as the meat and veg stew, now is a good time to season.</li>
        <li>If you're using fresh pasta cut it into sheets the same size as your baking dish</li>
        <li>Start with a layer of the meat sauce in the baking dish then a layer of pasta and then a layer of white/cheese sauce</li>
        <li>Make sure the final layer is the white/cheese sauce before covering with tinfoil and baking in the oven</li>
        <li>Once baked remove the foil and top with a layer of grated cheese before grilling/broiling until the cheese has melted and browned</li>
        <li>Make sure you leave the lasagne to stand for 10-15 minutes before serving, this will prevent the lasagne from falling apart as you serve</li>
    </ol>
